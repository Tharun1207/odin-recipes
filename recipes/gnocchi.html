        <h2 class="recipe-description-title">Description</h2>
        <p class="recipe-description">Gnocchi is simple to make with just three ingredients: mashed potato, flour, and egg. This recipe is one my family has used for generations.</p>

        <br>
        <h3 class="ingredients-title">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h3 class="steps-title">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a fork or potato masher.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.</li>
        </ol>
